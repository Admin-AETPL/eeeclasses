The NTSE is conducted by the NCERT. The first level of examination ( known as STSE) is conducted by the authorities of the state government, which do follow almost the same pattern as laid down by the NCERT. But the states had complete autonomy to design and conduct their written examinations. However, they were advised to follow the national pattern which comprised MAT and SAT.
<ul>
<li>The  MAT (Mental ability Test) and SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test )  will consist  of 90 questions each.</li>
<li>SAT will have 35 questions for Social Science (History, Geography, Civics and Economics), 35 for Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology )  and 20 for Mathematics.</li>
<li>Quota for a state will be computed proportionally on the basis of student enrolment in Classes VII and VIII.</li>
</ul>

<br />At the national level 3000 students are selected for the final test from entire states and UT. Every state has a proportionate quota of students for the final test. The quota for the Uttar Pradesh is approximately 550. A stipulated number of candidates who qualified at the national level examination were called for face-to-face interview. The award of scholarships was finally determined on the basis of the candidates' scores obtained in all the three components namely the MAT, the SAT and the Interview.
The amount of scholarship is Rs 500/- per month for all the students studying in Class IX onwards (irrespective of the class/course) except for Ph.D., wherein it is paid as per UGC norms.
